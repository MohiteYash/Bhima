 We are all well aware about Cortana, Siri, Google Assistant and many other virtual 
assistants which are designed to aid the tasks of users in Windows, Android and iOS 
platforms. But to our surprise, there’s no such complete virtual assistant available for Core 
Windows platform consisting of 70% of the users. So, this is actually a major problem for
users where there could be internet instability, server problems and places where internet is 
not accessible.

Solution:-

 This project started on the assumption that there is an adequate amount of openly 
obtainable information & data in the Internet that can be utilized to make a virtual assistant that 
has ability to building intelligent decisions for the regular user activities. In this modern world, 
almost everything is getting digitalized. We have smartphones with us and it is equal to having 
the world at your fingertip.
 The main aim of this project is to make a program that will be able to service humans 
like a personal assistant. This software aims at developing a virtual assistant for windows-based 
systems. The purpose of this application-software is to perform and execute the user's tasks for 
certain commands, given in either speech or text. It will ease the work of the user.
