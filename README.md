Problem Statement:-

We are all well aware about Cortana, Siri, Google Assistant and many other virtual 
assistants which are designed to aid the tasks of users in Windows, Android and iOS 
platforms. But to our surprise, there’s no such complete virtual assistant available for Core 
Windows platform consisting of 70% of the users. So, this is actually a major problem for
users where there could be internet instability, server problems and places where internet is 
not accessible.

Solution:-

 This project started on the assumption that there is an adequate amount of openly 
obtainable information & data in the Internet that can be utilized to make a virtual assistant that 
has ability to building intelligent decisions for the regular user activities. In this modern world, 
almost everything is getting digitalized. We have smartphones with us and it is equal to having 
the world at your fingertip.
 The main aim of this project is to make a program that will be able to service humans 
like a personal assistant. This software aims at developing a virtual assistant for windows-based 
systems. The purpose of this application-software is to perform and execute the user's tasks for 
certain commands, given in either speech or text. It will ease the work of the user.

would have to be done by opening the concerned email address. Here, you do not need to go 
for another tab to do one of the major tasks of your day-to-day affairs. The user can send emails 
to the desired receiver

QUERIES FROM GOOGLE - Making queries is an essential part of one’s life, and nothing 
changes even for a developer working on Windows. We have addressed the essential part of a 
netizen’s life by enabling our voice assistant to search the web. It supports a plethora of search 
engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo and displays the result by scraping the searched querie

ACCESSING YOUTUBE VIDEOS- Videos have remained as a main source of entertainment, 
one of the most prioritized tasks of virtual assistants. They are equally important for 
entertainment as well as educational purposes as most teaching and research activities in 
present times are done through YouTube. This helps in making the learning process more 
practical and out of the four walls of the classroom
